# Progressive web application

### Todo list
- [ ] Implement IndexDB for caching data (instead of localStorage), consider use [localForge](https://github.com/localForage/localForage)

### What is a Progressive Web App?
A Progressive Web App is:

- Progressive - Works for every user, regardless of browser choice because it's built with progressive enhancement as a core tenet.
- Responsive - Fits any form factor: desktop, mobile, tablet, or whatever is next.
- Connectivity independent - Enhanced with service workers to work offline or on low-quality networks.
- App-like - Feels like an app to the user with app-style interactions and navigation because it's built on the app shell model.
- Fresh - Always up-to-date thanks to the service worker update process.
- Safe - Served via HTTPS to prevent snooping and to ensure content hasn't been tampered with.
- Discoverable - Is identifiable as an "application" thanks to W3C manifest and service worker registration scope, allowing search engines to find it.
- Re-engageable - Makes re-engagement easy through features like push notifications.
- Installable - Allows users to "keep" apps they find most useful on their home screen without the hassle of an app store.
- Linkable - Easily share via URL, does not require complex installation.
